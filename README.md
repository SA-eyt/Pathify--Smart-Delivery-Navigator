# Pathify-Smart Delivery Navigator

## Overview
The code implements a navigation system using C++ with the FMX framework, primarily focused on pathfinding between different locations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Key Components

### Data Structures
- **Graph Implementation:** Utilizes both adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
- **Custom Node Struct:** Represents linked list elements.
- **Fixed-size Arrays:** Stores location names and distances.

### Core Functionality

#### Path Finding
- Implements **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path calculation.
- Supports **weighted, undirected edges**.
- Includes calculations for:
  - Distance
  - Fuel consumption
  - Travel time

#### GUI Integration
- Input validation for source and destination.
- Real-time feedback through labels and messages.
- Clear functionality for resetting inputs.

### Notable Features
- **Fuel Consumption Calculation:** Based on distance and fuel rate.
- **Travel Time Estimation:** Uses user-provided speed input.
- **Warning System:** Alerts for insufficient fuel.
- **Case-insensitive Matching:** Matches locations without regard to case.
- **Input Sanitization:** Ensures reliability and consistency.

## Technical Specifications
- **Language:** C++ with FMX framework.
- **Graph Size:** Fixed at 8 nodes.
- **Pre-defined Locations:** 8 destinations.
- **Edge Properties:** Bidirectional with weights.

## Limitations
- Fixed graph size of 8 nodes.
- Hard-coded location names.
- Static edge connections.
- No dynamic memory management for locations.

## Safety Features
- Input validation for all fields.
- Warning system for fuel requirements.
- Error messages for invalid locations.
- Input sanitization for consistency.

## Performance Considerations
- **Time Complexity:** O(V^2) for Dijkstra's implementation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V^2) for adjacency matrix storage.
