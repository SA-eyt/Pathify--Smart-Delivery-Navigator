# DSA Project: Pathify-Smart Delivery Navigator

A console-based application developed as part of Data Structures (DS) course project.

## Description

The **Smart Delivery Navigator** is a console-based application written in **C++**, designed to calculate the shortest delivery route in a city. The project demonstrates the use of **graphs** and other data structures to solve real-world routing problems efficiently. It will include transitioning to a **GUI-based application** for enhanced usability and visualization.

## Features

- Calculate the shortest delivery path using **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**.
- Display detailed information, including distance, estimated time, and fuel requirements.
- Interactive input system for managing delivery locations.
- Efficiently handles multiple delivery points with optimized algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
- **Platform:** Console-based application(GUI will be added as per the situation).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Project-Smart-Delivery-Navigator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd DSA-Project-Smart-Delivery-Navigator
    ```
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
    ```sh
    g++ -o delivery_navigator main.cpp
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    ./delivery_navigator
    ```
